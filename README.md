# Shopify-Dawn-Theme

The Clickable Image Banner

It will allow for the entire image banner to be clickable.
This code will give you the option of selecting a link for the image in the shopify editor once you've opted in for a image banner section. 
You must delete out the entire "image-banner.liquid" file under "Sections" and replace it with this code.
This code works for the Dawn Theme 6.0.2 version when last checked.
You will not receive the t.section error on the editor when using this code. 

However, this code is only for the first image. It will not allow a second image to be clickable. 
If you include a second image, the entire banner will be linked to the main image link.
